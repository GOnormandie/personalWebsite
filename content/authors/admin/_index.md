<p style='text-align: justify;'>Born and raised in Puerto Rico surrounded by nature, it seemed meant to be that I would become a scientist one day. I did my BSc at the University of Puerto Rico in Humacao where I worked with population dynamics of feral cats. My grandmothers transmitted their love for Orchids to me, and being an admirer of the work of Charles Darwin, I decided to complete a MSc studying orchids. I completed my MSc at the University of Puerto Rico in Río Piedras where I worked with the distribution and germination patterns of an epiphytic orchid endemic to Puerto Rico and how the interactions with its symbionts affect those patterns.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>I am an advocate for inclusivity and accessibility to science, which prompted me to work as a Data Manager for a Research Education company, where currently I am in charge of the creation of educational datasets and material for students in Puerto Rico.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>I am in love with books and have not been known to say no to a cup of coffee or a pastry. I believe that food taste better and the breeze at the beach is cozier when shared with friends and family.</p>
