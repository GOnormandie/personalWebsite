abstract: We explore phorophyte suitability for germination and establishment of the epiphytic orchid, Psychilis kraenzlinii. We found that the orchid grows on a subset of the available tree species and shows preference for the endemic Machaonia portoricensis (Rubiaceae). The orchid preferred trees with smoother bark with high water holding capacity and low water retention capacity. Microclimatic conditions under which embryos began pre-germination stages mirrored that of the adult orchid, but germination did not, suggesting that suitable germination sites are not necessarily the best sites for later stages of development.
