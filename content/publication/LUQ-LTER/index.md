abstract: The Luquillo Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program in Puerto Rico has implemented a Data Jam initiative that fosters student engagement in ecological data science. In December 2023, over 175 middle and high school students presented 51 data- driven projects at a symposium in El Yunque National Rainforest. The initiative, rooted in the LTER’s extensive datasets, allows students to develop research questions, analyze data using the CODAP tool, and present findings. The program includes professional development for teachers, with workshops and Virtual Lab Meetings that equip them to guide students through the scientific process. Teachers collaborate across disciplines, integrating Data Jam into their curricula. The program has positively impacted students, increasing their interest in local environmental issues and confidence in data analysis. The use of publicly available datasets tailored for educational purposes, alongside mentor support from LTER scientists, provides a robust framework for students to engage deeply with ecological data. This initiative not only enhances STEM education but also strengthens students’ connection to their local environment and the broader scientific community.
