<p style='text-align: justify;'> Scientists in Puerto Rico introduced the cane toad (<em>Rhinella marina</em>) as a biocontrol of <em>Phyllophaga</em> sp. (may beetle) infestation in sugar cane plantations in the early 1900s. Although the may beetle problem receded, scientist question whether this was thanks to the toad. In 1984, Freeland, W. J., stated that the decline of the beetle population in Puerto Rico was due to extreme wet and dry seasons between 1930-1936, and not the because of the introduction of the toad. Given the lack of data, we cannot evaluate if the introduction of <em>R. marina</em> was effective against the population of may beetles in Puerto Rico. Nonetheless, historical data of precipitation in Puerto Rico can be used to evaluate if during these years Puerto Rico had extreme wet and dry seasons.
