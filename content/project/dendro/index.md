<p style='text-align: justify;'> Morphological differences in flowers of <em>Dendrophylax</em> sp. in the Dominican Republic suggest speciation and exploitation of different pollinators. In collaboration with the National Botanical Garden Dr. Rafael Mar√≠a Moscoso in the Dominican Republic, and peers from the University of Illinois, we are conducting research to elucidate the taxonomy of <em>Dendrophylax</em> in La Hispaniola.

<p style='text-align: justify;'><strong> Morphological data of the flowers in different populations are being measured to proof that the differences that were previously observed are statistically significant. Since flower morphology is related to pollinators, we hypothesize that floral fragrance composition will also differ among populations, because different pollinators are being targeted. Therefore, we are conducting floral fragrance analysis from the different populations using GC-MS analysis. The pollinators of <em>Dendrophylax</em> in La Hispaniola are unknown. Nonetheless, given morphology and fragrance of the flower, we hypothesized that the pollinator is a hawkmoth. This is supported also by the fact that <em>D. lindenii</em> in Florida, USA is pollinated by hawkmoths. We are using light traps to try and catch a possible pollinator. To go even further on the determination of differentiation and speciation, we are collecting tissue form different species and populations to run DNA analysis and develop the phylogeny for <em>Dendrophylax</em> in La Hispaniola.
