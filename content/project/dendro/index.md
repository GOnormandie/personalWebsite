<p style='text-align: justify;'> Morphological differences in flowers of <em>Dendrophylax</em> sp. in the Dominican Republic suggest speciation and exploitation of different pollinators. We are conducting a floral fragrance composition analysis to detect further differences, as well as using light traps and visitation observations to identify the pollinators.
