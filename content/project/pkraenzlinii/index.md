<p style='text-align: justify;'> We  explore  phorophyte  suitability  for  germination  and  establishment  of  the  epiphytic  orchid,  Psychilis kraenzlinii. We found that the orchid grows on a subset of the available tree species and shows pref-erence for the endemic Machaonia portoricensis (Rubiaceae). The orchid preferred trees with smoother bark, high water holding capacity and low water retention capacity. Microclimatic conditions under which embryos began pre-germination stages mirrored that of the adult orchid, but germination did not, suggesting that suit-able germination sites are not necessarily the best sites for later stages of development.
